/**
 * Write a function that rotates a NxN matrix 90 degrees.
 *
 * A matrix, also called a 2-D array, is simply an array of arrays of values.
 *
 * Example 1x1 matrix:
 *   [ [1] ]
 *
 * Example 2x2 matrix:
 *  [ [1,2],
 *    [3,4] ]
 *
 * Important note:
 *   In mathematics, and generally in CS, matrices are identified as m-by-n, where m is
 *   the number of *rows* and n is the number of *columns*. So an [i][j] address in a matrix
 *   will be i places down, and j places over. This usually matches the way arrays are
 *   addressed in code, but keep in mind that it differs from use in geometry and computer
 *   graphics, where coordinates of the form (x,y) are usually x units over, and y units down.
 *
 * Example rotation of a 4x4 matrix:
 *
 * var matrix = [
 *  [1,2,3,4],
 *  [5,6,7,8],
 *  [9,'A','B','C'],
 *  ['D','E','F','G']
 * ];

 * [ ['D',9,5,1],
 *  ['E','A',6,2],
 *  ['F','B',7,3],
 *  ['G','C',8,4]
 * ]
